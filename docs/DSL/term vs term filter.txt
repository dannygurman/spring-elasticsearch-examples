Terms filter is automatically cached, whereas an or
filter of many term filters is not automatically cached.
But the results you will get back should be the same.

filter query is stored in cache.
(The cache implements an LRU eviction policy: when a cache becomes full,
the least recently used data is evicted to make way for new data.)

Term query-Returns documents that contain an exact term in a provided field.

In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?”
The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data, e.g.

GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title":   "Search"        }},
        { "match": { "content": "Elasticsearch" }}
      ],
      "filter": [
        { "term":  { "status": "published" }},
        { "range": { "publish_date": { "gte": "2015-01-01" }}}
      ]
    }
  }
}
