TF/IDF- Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency

Term frequency -How often does the term appear in the field?

Inverse document frequency-How often does the term appear in the index?

Field-length norm How long is the field which was searched?

Term Frequency- More often, more relevant A field containing 4 mentions of a term
is more relevant than one which has just one mention

Inverse Document Frequency-More often, less relevant
If the term is really common across documents in the index, its relevance for a particular document is low
 e.g. stopwords such as “the”, “this”

 Field-length Norm-
 Longer fields, less relevant
 A term appearing in a longer field is one of a larger set, so less relevant e.g.
 words in the title of a book are more relevant than words in the  contents

 Elasticsearch Relevance Algorithm
The TF/IDF score can be combined with other factors based on the query clause

The Common Terms Problem
Search for “The quick brown fox”
The word “the” is likely to match a huge number of documents With low relevance to the actual search
