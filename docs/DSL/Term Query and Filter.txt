The exact term needs to be found in the inverted index for indexed documents

The terms found in the index may vary based on how you analyze them!!
Query uses an analyzer to find the best matches.


Two Contexts of Search - Query Context and Search Context

Filters - The documents in the result are NOT  scored

Each document responds yes/no to whether it should be included in the result

Filters are automatically cached



The rule of a thumb would be to use filters for:
yes/no search
search on exact values (numeric, range and keyword)

Use queries for:
ambiguous result (some documents suit more than others)
full-text search
Unless you need relevance score or full-text search always try to use filters. Filters are “cheaper”.
