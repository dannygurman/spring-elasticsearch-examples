Four Types of Aggregations:Metric,Bucketing,Matrix,Pipeline

Metric - Aggregations over a set of documents suxh as Avg and the multi-value stats aggregation
- All documents in a search result
- Documents within a logical group

Bucketing - Logically group documents based on  search query
A document falls into a bucket if the criteria matches
Each bucket associated with a key

Matrix - Operates on multiple fields and produces a matrix result
Experimental and may change in future releases

Pipeline - Aggregations that work on the output of other aggregations
Experimental and may change in future releases

Cardinality, the number of unique values in a field

Enable fielddata for text fields via mappings

Search vs. Aggregations:
Search:
Inverted index of the terms present in documents
The terms themselves can be hashed and stored in the index
Which documents contain this term?”

Aggregation:
Actual value of fields present in documents
Actual values of the terms are needed, hash values do not suffice
“What is the value of this field for this document?”


Getting the Value of a Text Field Text:
Text field values are stored in an in-memory data structure called fielddata
fielddata is built on demand when a field is used for aggregations, sorting etc
fielddata on text fields take up lots of heap space
fielddata is disabled by default on text fields

Bucketing:
-------------
Indexed Documents - Logically group these documents into buckets
