Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine which runs on Lucene

An open source, search and analytics engine,written in Java built on Apache Lucene

Distributed: Scales to thousands of nodes

High availability: Multiple copies of data

RESTful API: CRUD, monitoring and other operation via simple JSON-based HTTP calls

Powerful Query DSL: Express complex queries simply

Schemaless: Index data without an explicit schema

Working with Elasticsearch: On local machines or As a service in  the cloud

Basic Concepts
------------------------

Near Realtime Search- ~1 second from the time a document is indexed until it becomes searchable

Node:
Single server
Performs indexing
Allows search
Has a unique id and name

Cluster:
Collection of nodes
Holds the entire indexed data
Has a unique name
Nodes join a cluster using the cluster name

Document:
Basic unit of information to be indexed
Expressed in JSON
Resides within an index
Documents need to be indexed so they can be searched

Index:
Collection of similar documents Identified by name
Any number of indices in a cluster
Different indices for different logical groupings

Shards:
Sometimes the amount of all docs size too large to fit in the hard disk of one node
or/and it too slow to serve all search requests from one node-
Split the index across multiple nodes in the cluster

Sharding an index
Search in parallel on multiple nodes

Replicas:
High availability in case a node fails
Scale search volume/throughput by searching multiple replicas

Shards and Replicas:
An index can be split into multiple shards
A shard can be replicated zero or moretimes
An index in Elasticsearch has 5 shards and 1 replica by default
