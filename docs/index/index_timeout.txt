Wait for active shards-
By default, index creation will only return a response to the client when the primary copies of each shard have
 been started, or the request times out. T
 he index creation response will indicate what happened:

{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "test"
}
acknowledged indicates whether the index was successfully created in the cluster,
 while shards_acknowledged indicates whether the requisite number of shard copies were started for each shard in the
  index before timing out.
Note that it is still possible for either acknowledged or shards_acknowledged to be false,
but the index creation was successful.
 These values simply indicate whether the operation completed before the timeout.
  If acknowledged is false, then we timed out before the cluster state was updated with the newly created index,
   but it probably will be created sometime soon.

   If shards_acknowledged is false, then we timed out before the requisite number of shards were started
   (by default just the primaries), even if the cluster state was successfully
    updated to reflect the newly created index (i.e. acknowledged=true).

We can change the default of only waiting for the primary shards to start through the index setting
index.write.wait_for_active_shards (note that changing this setting will also affect the wait_for_active_shards
 value on all subsequent write operations):

PUT /test
{
  "settings": {
    "index.write.wait_for_active_shards": "2"
  }
}

or through the request parameter wait_for_active_shards:

PUT /test?wait_for_active_shards=2

-------------------
Creating an index happens in multiple steps.
 First the master adds the new index to the cluster state,
  and then it allocates each shard (primaries and replicas) to nodes in the cluster.
   Typically it works on allocating more than one shard at once, but if it's busy then it might take some time before
   it gets around to the shards of this new index.

In response to the creation of an index, {"acknowledged":true} means that every node acknowledged just the first
state update in the process.
 I'm not sure this is that useful to an end-user - as long as a majority of the master nodes acknowledged the first
  state update then the index now exists, and you can tell that this has happened from the 200 OK response code.

The process also waits for some of the shards to be assigned, using the wait_for_active_shards and
timeout parameters 3, which default to waiting for up to 30 seconds for just the primaries all to be assigned.
 However if this times out then you don't see any difference in the response.
  This means that you can indeed create an index and receive a 200 OK response with {"acknowledged":true}
  even though the index is not fully created.

If this matters to you, you should repeatedly call GET _cluster/health/<index>?wait_for_status=yellow
until this returns 200 OK, since this guarantees that all the primaries have indeed been assigned.
