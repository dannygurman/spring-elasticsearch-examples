Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene and was first released by Elasticsearch N.V. (now Elastic) in 2010.
 According to the website of Elastic, it is a distributed open-source search and analytics engine f
 or all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.

 The operations of Elasticsearch are available as REST APIs. The primary functions are:

 storing documents in an index,
 searching the index with powerful queries to fetch those documents, and
 run analytic functions on the data.
 Spring Data Elasticsearch provides a simple interface to perform these operations on
  Elasticsearch as an alternative to using the REST APIs directly.
